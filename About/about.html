    <h1> About Me </h1>

    <p> Hello! My name is Eddy Wen and I am a recent graduate of UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz) where I studied Computer Science and Mathematics. Now that I am done with college, I am looking towards developing my skillset in both fields. As of now, I'm looking towards software development, network engineering, or information technologies. </p>

    <p> In my free time, I like to do mathematics. It is the reason why I decided to major in both fields. In regards to mathematics, my favorite fields are finite geometry and group theory. There is something very satisfying that comes with solving a complex theorem using preset axioms. Currently, I am self teaching myself graph theory and combinatorics. I'll hopefully do some projects in both fields later on. Maybe even post some of my solutions of math problems for the fun of it </p>

    <p> Speaking of projects, as you noticed, I have my own website! I didn't really study much webdesign in college (I was more into networking and general software development). So upon leaving, I noticed a lot of companies do like web development skills. Well, I thought this would be a perfect time to start studying HTML and CSS. As of now, this website is written in pure HTML and CSS. I like building things from scratch when learning. It helps me develop the fundamentals. Although after finishing the rough draft, I hope to "upgrade" this site by using React (when that happens I think I'll have an archive section where you can see the original HTML and CSS files). </p>

   <p> Well of course that isn't the only thing. On this site, you'll see some of the other things that I have done for fun or for schooe. I have seperated them both into Math and Computer Science respectively. If you want to see something purely math based (proofs, code that simulates math concepts, or code that solves certain math problems) head over <a href="../Math/math.html">here</a>. For something more Computer Science based (game design, algorithms and data structures, and data analyst) head over <a href="../ComputerScience/cs.html">here</a>. </p>

   <p> Thank you for checking out my website and if you wish to contact me please email me at eddyjwen@gmail.com. </p>
